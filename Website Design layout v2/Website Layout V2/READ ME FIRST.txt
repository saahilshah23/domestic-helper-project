Please note that these 'blueprints' for the website 'Domestic Helper' may note completely resemble the final product, some features may be added or removed.
Colour has not really been added, instead, focus on the functionality from the product backlog and see how it has been implemented in the design.
I will add color as i go along as this will be easier to change.

Thanks,
Sam
